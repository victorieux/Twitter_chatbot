The party trying to deliver #Brexit are the Tories. They got their arses whooped, they lost.

"Lessons from #BreconByelection
1. Tories LOST almost 50% of their vote
2. Remain voted tactically #ABTV
3. Farage is just #ukip 2.0 and has little support
4. Labour under Corbyn is a lost cause
5. There is no majority for #brexit
6. There never was a mandate to #leave

Tot up the votes in #Brecon for the pro-#Brexit parties to make a #LeaveAlliance. Ignoring Labour (not sure what they stand for), CON+BREX+UKIP = 15,974, vs 13,826 for LDEM. 

Or 53.6% #Leave, 46.4% #Remain."

"""Brexit isn't just about the act of leaving the EU. It means ending our current relationship with the EU countries AND forming a new one. Now, given that the 2016 didn't decide that, people need a chance to compare the new one with the old one, BEFORE we lose the old one"""

@wallaceme @Fox_Claire Well said Claire. I said the same to Tobias Ellwood last night on BBC. The fact that he as a Remain Tory voter now accepts a No Deal exit from Boris demonstrates the effectiveness of the Brexit Party.  This would not be the case without the pressure we are exerting.
