 BenPBradshaw Well done. It’s clear  DominicRaab is blatantly lying when he says ‘no-deal’ was part of the EU Ref. It wasn’t. Shameful that top tier of Gov feel they can just lie & get away with it. They have no mandate. #democracy #Brexit
My view on #brexit. We'll  leave with a poor deal but promoted as a good deal, there will be a transition period, UK money will still flow to Brussels, we will adhere to many rules, business as usual. Any financial hiccup can be blamed on not being in. Few years maybe rejoin.

Ignore polls designed to drive vote, not predict it. The mission is simple, we must get out of the #EU then get rid of the parasites at the top of this poll. #Brexit is about more than just leaving the EU, it is an opportunity for real change.

@StrumJumbo @MollieW152 @DehennaDavison Why? You think #Brexit will be forgotten if at the next GE after a failure to leave the #EU, #Labour get in, because they get 35% to #tory 25% and #BrexitParty 15%? No way!

Thank you, @NatWest_Help for activating non-UK mobile numbers as a means of communication and security for online banking. I was already afraid I might have to close my acc after #Brexit, but I take this step as a good omen that I can keep it. :)
@SteveBakerHW Sorry @SteveBakerHW but you have asked for this as a political party that has failed to carry out it’s promises. Although you are not directly responsible the trust has gone. If the election happens before #Brexit you will need to form a pact with @Nigel_Farage or be destroyed.

@brexit_politics @strolltoitaly That would be due to the Bank of England reducing interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%, £10billion in corporate bonds, £60billion QE and £100billion to banks to pass on base rate cuts. And now £2.1billion for No Deal planning. Can't wait for the #Brexit dividend....

Both Nigel Farage's #Brexit Party and Jo Swinson's Lib Dems are telling half of voters that they don't want their votes. Boris Johnson wants to win a general election by relying on Farage forming an electoral pact and Lib Dem and Blairite MPs damaging Jeremy Corbyn. #JC4PM

@NoseyMass @Frances_Coppola @Timotheus_ The racism isn't caused by #Brexit, but chances are a lot of the manifestations we see recently have been enabled by Brexit.
